# Pintos
A mini Operating System


Pintos is a tiny, basic, instructional operating system created by Ben Pfaff of Stanford's University in 2004 for learning purpose. It is not a complete Opearting System that supports all the things which we studies in undergraduate course. It provides us a basic kernel skeleton with minimum functionality.

The task of us will be to enhance the functionality of the existing kernel.

The task includes threading, file system, user programs execution, and virtual memory
