# Pintos
A mini Operating System


Pintos is a tiny, basic, instructional operating system created by Ben Pfaff of Stanford's University in 2004 for learning purpose. It is not a complete Opearting System that supports all the things which we studies in undergraduate course. It provides us a basic kernel skeleton with minimum functionality.

The task of us will be to enhance the functionality of the existing kernel.
